### **Setting up AWS credential for the Docker Container (OPTIONAL)**

The following instruction assumes that you have this branch checkout already. Let's pretend the path of this branch is C:\Homework\test-full-stack on a Windows machine.  You will need to go the "docker" folder
    
   ![alt text](images/step0.png "Logo Title Text 1")
                                                                                                                                          
 1. Go to the AWS folder and make a copy of config.dev and
    credential.dev.    
    
    ![alt text](images/step1.png "Logo Title Text 1")
        
 2. Remove the .dev extension so the files will just be config and
    credential
    
    ![alt text](./images/step2.png "Logo Title Text 1")
       
 3. Put in the AWS region you want in config
 
    ![alt text](./images/step3.png "Logo Title Text 1")
     
 4. Put in the aws_access_key and aws_access _secret in the credential
    files.

###  **Getting ready to run Docker**


1. Go to the docker folder under this project.
   
2. Open the scripts folder.

3. Make a copy of .env.developement and remove the .development so the file will just be .env

   ![alt text](./images/step7.png "Logo Title Text 1")
     
4. Put in the current project directory path to LOCAL_PROJECT_PATH. In the example we are in C:\Homework\test-full-stack.
  
   ![alt text](./images/step8.png "Logo Title Text 1") 
   
   EXAMPLE ONLY !!!! please put in the correct path on where this branch sits in your computer.    
   
1. Open shell/command line on your computer and go to the following path.

   ![alt text](./images/step5.png "Logo Title Text 1")
   
5. Now type in `docker-compose up` andâ€¦crosses finger everything will run smoothly, This might take a couple of minutes.  If it does your service deployment environment is set up, yay !!!!!!!!

### Execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

1. Open shell/command line on your computer and go to the following path.

   ![alt text](./images/step5.png "Logo Title Text 1")
``   
3. Run `./bash_it.sh `
4. You should be in the bash shell on the container and be in the app directory.

5. Go to tc_sf_fullstack_test, this will be the directory that contains the project code within the container.
