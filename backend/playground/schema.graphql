"The `AWSDate` scalar type provided by AWS AppSync, represents a valid ***extended*** [ISO 8601 Date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Calendar_dates) string. In other words, this scalar type accepts date strings of the form `YYYY-MM-DD`.  The scalar can also accept \"negative years\" of the form `-YYYY` which correspond to years before `0000`. For example, \"**-2017-05-01**\" and \"**-9999-01-01**\" are both valid dates.  This scalar type can also accept an optional [time zone offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_zone_designators). For example, \"**1970-01-01**\", \"**1970-01-01Z**\", \"**1970-01-01-07:00**\" and \"**1970-01-01+05:30**\" are all valid dates. The time zone offset must either be `Z` (representing the UTC time zone) or be in the format `Â±hh:mm:ss`. The seconds field in the timezone offset will be considered valid even though it is not part of the ISO 8601 standard."

"The `AWSTimestamp` scalar type provided by AWS AppSync, represents the number of seconds that have elapsed since `1970-01-01T00:00Z`. Negative values are also accepted and these represent the number of seconds till `1970-01-01T00:00Z`.  Timestamps are serialized and deserialized as integers. The minimum supported timestamp value is **`-31557014167219200`** which corresponds to `-1000000000-01-01T00:00Z`. The maximum supported timestamp value is **`31556889864403199`** which corresponds to `1000000000-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`."
