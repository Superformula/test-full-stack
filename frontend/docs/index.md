### Functionality

- ~~The search functionality should perform real time filtering on client side data and API side data~~
- ~~List of users should be updated automatically after single user is updated~~
- ~~Create modal from scratch - please don't use any library for it~~
- ~~Appear/Disappear of modal should be animated (feel free with choose how)~~
- Infinite loading state should be saved in url query (pagination state should be present in URL query (eg ?page=1) to allow for behavior where the user can reload the page while still returning to their current scroll position)
__**This can be easily achieved by saving the `lastKey` property in the url and loading it on `Dashboard.js` component.**__
